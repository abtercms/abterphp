# AbterPHP

[![Build Status](https://github.com/abtercms/abterphp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/abtercms/abterphp/actions)

AbterPHP is the first and currently the only implementation of AbterCMS, providing backend, frontend and a REST API for it.
It does not require much JavaScript knowledge as it uses jQuery instead of some nodejs based solution, therefore many might
find it easier to learn, maintain or deploy.

It is based on the excellent [Opulence](https://www.opulencephp.com/) framework.

## Why another CMS?

The system has 3 reasons to exist:
1. Provide an easily accessible alternative to anyone who needs a truly simple website.
2. Educational purposes.
3. Provide a reasonably solid base for dev-shops that have PHP resources now, but want to keep their tech stack open for change.

You'll find more information on design decisions on the website.

## AbterCMS

AbterCMS is a polyglot CMS system which is meant to provide both easily customizable, maintainable and deployable website
solutions for simple use cases, and also a solid base for startups iterating over ideas fast.

It is planned that there will be at least a Go API and some nodejs based backend and frontend solution. (Elm, Vue or React most likely.) 

## Status

AbterPHP backend and frontend are almost feature complete, but the API is not stable, not complete and not properly
tested yet. The code coverage is already quite good, around 95% overall. Documentation is at very early stages.
Therefore the current status is **Pre-alpha**.

## Installation

### Development

#### Pre-requisite: Grab the source code

This should be fairly obvious if you're reading it, but feel free to download the code from Github or clone the repository.
Just use the "Clone or download" button to get you started.

#### Pre-requisite: Install [docker](https://docker.com/)

The recommended way of getting started with the AbterPHP is via docker. While it is not necessarily mandatory, some of the
documentation might assume that all developers use `docker` for development. If you want to run the code, you'll have to
ensure that you have the right version of PHP, with the neccessary modules and that you have at least a supported version
of MySQL (or later PostgreSQL). While having Redis or Memcached is great, those are not mandatory.

#### Pre-requisite: Install [mkcert](https://mkcert.dev/)

Since security is a top priority, pure http is not supported out of the box, therefore you'll need to install a certificate. 
The recommended way is using `mkcert`. While it is not necessarily mandatory, some of the
documentation might assume that all developers use `mkcert` for development. 

#### Pre-requisite: Open the project in a console

The rest of the installation documentation will assume that `.` is the root directory of the project.

#### Pre-requisite: Fetch submodules

To make sure you can use docker as your development platform, you should make sure to have all the configs associated.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Later, to update the submodules, use the following git command:

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

#### Pre-requisite: Add abtercms.test as localhost in `/etc/hosts` on Linux and OSX or `???` on Windows.

```bash
# /etc/hosts
# [...]
127.0.0.1	abtercms.test
```

#### Create certificate

Since security is a top priority, you'll need to create a certificate and move it into `docker/nginx/certs/`

```bash
mkcert abtercms.test "*.abtercms.test"
mv abtercms.test+1* ./docker/nginx/certs/
```

#### Set some permissions

```bash
chmod -R 0777 ./tmp ./public/tmp
chmod +x apex
```

#### Spin up the containers

```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Install the dependencies

To install dependencies, we recommend running `make` from inside the PHP container:

```bash
docker-compose exec cli make
```

#### Ensure your settings are sane

Although we try to provide a reasonable set of settings for getting started quickly, at this point you may want to edit
`config/environment/.env.app.php` to make your settings sane for your needs. Please note however that these values can
be and in some cases will be overwritten by your environment variables. This means that if you are running the system
with `docker-compose` than you might need to edit some of these values in `docker-compose.yml`.

If you do not have the file `config/environment/.env.app.php` then something must have gone wrong in the previous step,
because it should be created during `php composer.phar install`.

More documentation on the settings will be written later.

#### Install the db schema and create a new admin user

You need to log into the PHP container (again) run migrations and create a user.

*Note:* That AbterPHP uses [zxcvbn-php](https://github.com/bjeavons/zxcvbn-php) to verify password strength. This is
a modern library that does not enforce rules like using numbers and smaller and upper case characters nor does it
simply count characters. E.g `ryvenglotbutnofasewordpass` is a strong password, but `verylongbutnotsafepassword` is not.
(To help migrating users from other systems, it is possible to create users using weak password with the `--unsafe` argument.)

```
docker-compose exec php sh
> ./apex migrations:up
> ./apex user:create {username} {email} {strongPassword} admin en
> exit
```


If everything went well, you should be able to log in with your new user at `https://abtercms.test/login-iddqd`, given
that you haven't yet changed your `ADMIN_LOGIN_PATH` environment variable in `config/environment/.env.app.php`.

### Production

Since AbterPHP is in **Early Preview** state, you probably shouldn't deploy it to production at the moment.

## Stack

AbterPHP is based on [Opulence](https://www.opulencephp.com/), but uses a few more projects alongside Opulence:
 - [Monolog](https://seldaek.github.io/monolog/) for logging
 - [Whoops](https://filp.github.io/whoops/) for error reporting in non-production environments
 - [Flysystem](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/docs/) for handling filesystem (incomplete implementation)
 - [Casbin](https://casbin.org/) for authorization
 - [Minify](https://www.minifier.org/) for minifying assets (Website module)
 - [Swiftmailer](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/) for sending emails (Contact module)
 - [Slugify](https://github.com/cocur/slugify) for creating web-safe identifiers (Admin module)
 - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for most of the JavaScript in place (Admin module)
 - [js-sha3](https://github.com/emn178/js-sha3) for browser-side encryption (Admin module)
 - [Trumbowyg](https://alex-d.github.io/Trumbowyg/documentation/) as a wysiwyg solution (Admin module)
 - [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) from Dropbox for password strength estimations (Admin module)
 - [zxcvbn-php](https://github.com/bjeavons/zxcvbn-php) PHP version of `zxcvbn` (Admin module)
 - [OAuth 2.0 Server](https://oauth2.thephpleague.com/authorization-server/client-credentials-grant/) for API authentication and authorization with [Nyholm/psr7](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7) as PSR-7 request / response library.

If you want to contribute code you'll also need to get familiar with these tools:
 - [PhpUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for unit tests
 - [vfsStream](https://github.com/mikey179/vfsStream) for mocking the filesystem
 - [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) for code formatting
 - [PHPMD - PHP Mess Detector](https://phpmd.org/) for code quality
 
AbterPHP currently only supports MySQL as the database system, although PostgreSQL support is very likely to happen
before the first stable version.
